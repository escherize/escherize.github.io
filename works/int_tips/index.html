   - I'm not comfortable sharing that information I would prefer to
     focus on the value I can add to this company and not what I'm
     paid at my current job.
   - At my current role I am very well compensated, and I'm certainly
     looking for compensation that is a good fit for me, but I'm also
     looking for a better fit in terms of my values and where I want
     to be with my career.
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Desired Salary?                                           </span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-tag">:desired:salary:</span></span>
   - I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both
     responsibility and compensation.
   - I would rather know more about the job before I discuss that, why dont you tell me more about the salary possibilities at this job?
   - Its harder for me to name a number without knowing about the
     role, total compensation package, and growth possibilities - so
     can u help me by explaining what <span class="org-verbatim">=Company=</span> has to say about that?
   - I dont feel comfortable naming a number without more information,
     so if you can get me some info I can get back to you about that.
   - I'm interested in the full compensation package + I'm interested
     in career growth opportunities.
   - I'd love to hear what you're willing to offer and what <span class="org-verbatim">=Company=</span>
     has to say about it, and we can move forward from there, I'd like
     to contiune the conversation after you make an offer.
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* How much is your other offer for?                                  </span><span class="org-level-2"><span class="org-tag">:offer:</span></span>
   - It's a competitive offer, but I'm interested in the whole package: the work I do, the value I can provide, and all the different forms of compensation, and how that can fit with <span class="org-verbatim">=company=</span>
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Why do you want to work here?</span>
<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* highlight why the company is cool and interesting</span>
<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* interesting problems / challenges for the company</span>
    Could be data ingestion / staffing issues / etc.

   - I'm excited to get working here + appreciate the offer
   - In terms of the salary for the responsibilites / etc. this number is quite far off. I want this job and i want to work here, but right now we are pretty far off.
<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* Instead of giving in to a low number</span>
    - Could you please walk me through the numbers?
    - How did you reach that salary?
<span class="org-hide">**</span><span class="org-level-3">* "This is the standard rate we pay everyone"</span>
    - I understand this is a standard rate for a typical candidate, but I'm not a typical candidate based on my experience and based on the skill sets that I'm bringing to the job.
