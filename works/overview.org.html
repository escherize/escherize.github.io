</span>   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm not comfortable sharing that information I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company and not what I'm paid at my current job.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> At my current role I am very well compensated, and I'm certainly looking for compensation that is a good fit for me, but I'm also looking for a better fit in terms of my values and where I want to be with my career.
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Desired Salary?
</span>   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I would rather know more about the job before I discuss that, why dont you tell me more about the salary possibilities at this job?
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> Its harder for me to name a number without knowing about the role, total compensation package, and growth possibilities - so can u help me by explaining what <span class="org-verbatim">=Company=</span> has to say about that?
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I dont feel comfortable naming a number without more information, so if you can get me some info I can get back to you about that.
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'm interested in the full compensation package + I'm interested in career growth and opportunities
   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> I'd love to hear what you're willing to offer and what <span class="org-verbatim">=Company=</span> has to say about it, and we can move forward from there, I'd like to contiune the conversation after you make an offer
<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* How much is your other offer for?
</span>   <span class="org-list-dt">-</span> It's a competitive offer, but I'm interested in the whole package: the work I do, the value I can provide, and all the different forms of compensation, and how that can fit with <span class="org-verbatim">=company=</span>
